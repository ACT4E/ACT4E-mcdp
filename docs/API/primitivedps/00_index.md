# Overview

The "PrimitiveDPs" objects corresponds to the morphisms in the category of design problems DP.


## Common interface

All of them are subclasses of [PrimitiveDP][act4e_mcdp.primitivedps.PrimitiveDP].


::: act4e_mcdp.primitivedps
    options:
      members:
        - PrimitiveDP


## Identity

The simplest DP is the identity design problem, 
described by the class [IdentityDP][act4e_mcdp.primitivedps.IdentityDP].


::: act4e_mcdp.primitivedps
    options:
      members:
        - IdentityDP
