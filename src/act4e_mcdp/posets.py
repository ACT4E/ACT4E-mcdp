    This represents a closed interval of numbers.

    The top and bottom are given as decimals. Top might be +inf.

    The units are given as a string. If empty, the units are dimensionless.

    The **step** is given as a decimal. If 0, the poset is "continuous", in the
    sense that all decimals are allowed. If non-zero, then it represents the steps.
    For example, the natural numbers are given by bottom=0, top=+inf, step=1.

    The numbers [0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0] are given by bottom=0.5, top=2.0, step=0.1.


    Attributes:
        bottom (Decimal): Lower bound of the interval.
        top (Decimal): Upper bound of the interval.
        step (Decimal): Step of the interval. If 0, the poset is "continuous".
        units (str): Units of the interval. If an empty string, the units are dimensionless.
